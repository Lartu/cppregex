# ðŸ¦™ cppregex
Cppregex is a very simple, single header file, easy to use C++11 std::regex wrapper for lazy people that just want to use regex in C++ without having to mingle with std::regex boilerplate code. In other words, a **simple C++ regex library**.

I've just uploaded this repository! Cppregex is under development at this very moment. Come back later!
